#  What is Beast Saga? 

Beast Saga is a 1-4 player cooperative, turn-based card game where you and your friends play as valiant Beasts fighting to protect their homeland from the invading armies of intelligent machines.

The game takes place on a modular battlefield, where each player can customize the board to their liking before each game. Players will use cards to summon creatures, cast spells, and perform heroic feats in order to defeat their opponents.

Beast Saga is currently in development by Awaken Realms, the creators of Renegade and Lords of Waterdeep. The game is set to release in late 2019. 

# What are the Beasts of Beast Saga? 

There are six playable Beasts in Beast Saga: the lion, the panther, the elephant, the hawk, the dragon, and the ogre. Each Beast has their own unique stats and abilities that make them ideally suited for different strategies. 

Lions are strong but slow creatures that can take a lot of damage before going down. They excel at taking out large numbers of enemies at once with their powerful attacks. 

Panthers are agile and quick creatures that can easily outmaneuver their opponents. They deal heavy damage with their sharp claws but are fragile compared to some of the other Beasts. 

Elephants are tough tanky creatures that can absorb a lot of punishment. Their massive trampling attack is devastating against groups of enemies, but they’re not very fast or nimble. 

Hawks are swift and deadly creatures that can easily pick off weaker enemies from a distance. They have low health but make up for it with their powerful aerial attacks. 

Dragons are fearsome creatures that can deal massive amounts of damage in a short amount of time. They’re slow but heavily armoured, making them ideal for taking on larger numbers of enemies head-on. 

Ogres are big and burly creatures that can take a lot of punishment without batting an eyelash. However, they’re slow and lack agility, making them vulnerable to speedy opponents.
