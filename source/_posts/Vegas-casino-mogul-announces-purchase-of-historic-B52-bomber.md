#  Vegas casino mogul announces purchase of historic B52 bomber

Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has announced his intention to purchase a historic B52 bomber. The move is seen as an attempt by the billionaire to increase tourist traffic to his casinos in Las Vegas and Macau.

The plane, which is currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, will be shipped to a yet-to-be-determined location in either state. "This is a major acquisition for my company," said Adelson at a press conference yesterday. "It will bring people from all over the world to see this amazing piece of aviation history."

The B52 bomber was first introduced into service in 1952 and saw extensive action in the Vietnam War. It was retired from active duty in 1992 but has remained in service with the air force reserves. The plane on display at the museum is one of only two remaining airworthy models.

Adelson did not disclose how much he paid for the bomber but hinted that it was a "significant investment." He added that he plans to use it as a "flying billboard" to promote his hotels and casinos.

The steel behemoth, which first flew in 1952 and was decommissioned in 1993, will become the centerpiece of a new outdoor attraction at the $2.5 billion resort, to be called "The Park."

"This is a tremendous acquisition for The Park and for our guests," said Robert Goldstein, president of Resort Properties of America, the Adelson-owned company that is developing the property. "The B-52 is an American icon and its addition will make our outdoor attraction one of the most unique in the country."

Adelson, who ranks as the eighth-richest person in America with a net worth of $25.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, already owns one of the world's largest collections of slot machines. The new resort will house his personal collection of antique cars as well.
