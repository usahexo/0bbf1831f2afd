#  City known for gambling

Las Vegas is a city in the United States of America known for its gambling. The city is located in the state of Nevada. Gambling was legalized in the state of Nevada in 1931. Las Vegas, which means "the meadows" in Spanish, was founded in 1905 as a railroad town and became a resort city in the 1920s. The city's growth accelerated after World War II, and it became an internationally renowned resort destination. Major hotel and casino resorts are located on the Las Vegas Strip, including Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Bellagio, and Venetian.

The Las Vegas area has been home to Native Americans for over 2,000 years. The first Europeans to visit the area were Spanish explorers led by Antonio de Mendoza in 1536. They were looking for the fabled Cíbola but did not find it. Father Francisco Garces, a Spanish Catholic missionary, is believed to have been the first European to enter the valley in 1776.

Las Vegas was founded by William Andrews Clark Jr., Milton McGregor, and Benjamin Siegel in 1905 as a railroad town and became a resort city in the 1920s. Clark County was established on January 1, 1909 from land transferred from Lincoln County. The county was named for William Andrews Clark Jr., a wealthy mining magnate and U.S. Senator from Montana who played a significant role in Las Vegas' early development.[15]

In 1911, Steve Brodie jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge into New York's East River wearing only his underwear and survived.[16] He claimed that he had done it intentionally to win a $100 bet and went on to perform the stunt across America.[17] In 1919, Chicago gangster Al Capone took refuge at the Hotel Nevada (now closed) in Downtown Las Vegas following his mob-ordered killing of seven men during the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.[18]and In 1922, Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler opened the Del Mar Racetrack near San Diego, California.[19] The racetrack brought many people to West Coast racing facilities; Chandler also began buying property on which he would develop real estate near Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue.[20]

The legalization of gambling in Nevada came about when federal agents tried to shut down illegal casinos that were being run by local organized crime syndicates such as Meyer Lansky's Miami Mob operation. Those casinos were using off-shore banking operations to circumvent federal anti-money laundering laws. A meeting was arranged between then-mobster Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel and five representatives from Nevada's congressional delegation: Carl Hayden (D), Pat McCarran (D),an Democrat Howell Heflin (D), Paul Laxalt (R), and Democrat Walter Baring (D). At that meeting, Siegel proposed that ifNevada legalized gambling, he would personally invest $2 million into building a luxurious hotel-casino on 12 acres he had purchased at State Route 91and Las Vegas Boulevard .[21]

After some wheeling and dealing with state politicians,[22][23][24] gaming licenses were granted for resorts located outside of Reno and Sparks which would be closer to Los Angelesand San Francisco; these would become known as tourist traps .[22][25][26][27]. Some people credited Siegel with creating Las Vegas' tourism industry .[28][29], while others assert that Mafia money did more to develop the town than Siegel did ..
