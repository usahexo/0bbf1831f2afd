#  Italy's biggest sports betting company to sponsor Virtus Bologna

After months of negotiation, Italy's biggest sports betting company, Betfair, has signed a sponsorship deal with Virtus Bologna. The partnership will see the betting company become the main sponsor of the basketball club.

The sponsorship is a major coup for Virtus Bologna, who have been struggling to find a new main sponsor since their previous agreement with online casino games provider SNAI expired at the end of last season. The deal is also a boost for Betfair, who are keen to expand their presence in the Italian market.

"Virtus Bologna is one of the most prestigious and successful clubs in Italy," said Betfair CEO Breon Corcoran. "We're delighted to be partnering with them and we're looking forward to working together to achieve even more success on and off the court."

The three-year agreement will see Betfair's logo feature on the front of Virtus Bologna's jerseys and they will also have branding rights inside the stadium. In addition, there will be a number of marketing and promotional activities between the two sides.

This is not the first time that Betfair has sponsored a basketball team. They are currently partners with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel and last year they announced a three-year deal with EuroLeague side Olympiacos Piraeus.

#  Sports betting now open for Virtus Bologna games

The Italian basketball club Virtus Bologna has announced that it will now allow sports betting on its games, as the new season gets underway. This move is likely to increase interest in the team, and could lead to more wins on the court.

Bologna is no stranger to sports betting, as it has been legal in Italy for many years. However, this is the first time that the team has decided to actively promote it. In fact, betting on Virtus Bologna games will be available through a special app, which can be downloaded by anyone who is over 18 years of age.

This new development is sure to create excitement among fans of the team, who can now place bets on whether or not their favourite players will score points or help their team win. And with so much at stake, there is sure to be plenty of competition between supporters as they try to guess the right outcome.

Virtus Bologna has already had a successful start to the season, winning its first two games. This could be due in part to the new betting option, as fans now have even more reason to get behind their team. Coach Claudio Coldebella is certainly hoping that this trend continues, as he looks to lead Virtus Bologna to victory.

Basketball is a very popular sport in Italy, and there are many fans of both Virtus Bologna and other local clubs. As a result, there is already a lot of interest in sports betting on these matches. With the addition of this new app, even more people are likely to get involved.

So far, the reaction to this news has been positive. Many people are looking forward to being able to place bets on their favourite teams, and believe that this will add an extra dimension to the games. There is no doubt that sports betting can be exciting, and it will be interesting to see how this affects proceedings on the court in Italy.
