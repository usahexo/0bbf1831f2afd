#  Titans Rebuilding Process Finally Shows Signs of Progress

The Tennessee Titans have had a surprisinglysuccessful season so far in 2017. At 8-4, they are currently in firstplace in the AFC South. This is a dramatic turnaround from their previousthree seasons, when they finished with a combined record of 11-37.

Quarterback Marcus Mariota has been a big part of the team’sclear improvement. He has thrown for 2,942 yards and 26 touchdownswith only 9 interceptions. The Titans’ rushing attack has also beenstrong, with DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry combining for 1,462yards and 17 touchdowns on the ground.

The team’s success can largely be attributed to its soliddefensive play. The Titans are ranked 4th in the NFL in points allowed,giving up only 19.1 per game. Their defense features Pro Bowlers such as Jurrell Casey, Jason McCourty, and Brian Orakpo.

While the Titans have clearly improved this season, there arestill some areas that need improvement. Their receiving corps iscurrently one of the weakest in the league, with no player having over500 receiving yards. In addition, they have struggled in close games,winning only 3 out of 7 games decided by one touchdown or less.

If the Titans can continue to improve in these areas, they couldvery well make a run at the Super Bowl this year.

#  Mariota and the Titans offense look strong in preseason

The Tennessee Titans offense looked strong in the preseason with quarterback Marcus Mariota leading the way. The Titans have a new offensive coordinator this season in Matt LaFleur, and it looks like he has made some changes that are benefiting Mariota and the team.

One of the main changes has been the use of more play-action passes. This was a staple of the Sean McVay offense in Los Angeles last season, and it seems to be working well for Mariota and the Titans. In last week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mariota completed six of seven play-action passes for 69 yards and a touchdown.

Another change that LaFleur has made is to get the ball into the hands of his playmakers more often. Last season, Derrick Henry had just 160 touches from scrimmage, which was fifth on the team. This season, LaFleur is planning to get Henry more involved in the offense. In last week's game, Henry had six carries for 33 yards and two catches for 26 yards.

The Titans also have some explosive new weapons in wide receivers Corey Davis and A.J. Brown. Brown was a second-round pick in this year's draft, and he has already shown that he can make big plays. In last week's game, Brown had four catches for 69 yards, including a touchdown reception from Mariota.

The Titans' offense looks like it could be one of the best in the league this season, and Mariota appears to be poised for another big year.

#  Can the Titans take advantage of a weak AFC South?

The AFC South doesn't seem as strong as it has in past years. The Titans have a good chance to take advantage and win the division.

The Texans had an off year last year, and the Colts don't seem to be getting better. The Jaguars are improving, but they are still not at the same level as the Titans.

The Titans have a lot of talent, especially on offense. Marcus Mariota is one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and he has a lot of good receivers to throw to, including Corey Davis and Rishard Matthews.

The Titans also have a good running game with Derrick Henry. The offensive line is one of the best in the league, and they will be able to open up holes for Henry to run through.

The defense is also improved this year. They added Jurrell Casey and Malcolm Butler in free agency, and they will be able to help shut down opposing offenses.

The Titans are definitely the best team in the AFC South, and they have a good chance to win the division this year.

#  Titans could be surprise contenders this year

The Tennessee Titans have been one of the most improved teams in the NFL this offseason, and they could be poised for a breakout year in 2018.

The Titans added some key pieces this offseason, including Malcolm Butler and Dion Lewis. Butler is coming off of a Super Bowl win with the New England Patriots, and Lewis is one of the most versatile running backs in the NFL.

Quarterback Marcus Mariota also looks to be healthy again after missing several games last season due to a knee injury. Mariota showed flashes of brilliance as a rookie in 2015, and if he can stay healthy, he could be a superstar in 2018.

The Titans also have one of the best defenses in the NFL. They ranked third in points allowed last season, and they added some key pieces this offseason, including linebacker Rashaan Evans and defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand.

Tennessee will have a tough test early on this season, as they play the Houston Texans, Philadelphia Eagles and Jacksonville Jaguars in their first three games. However, if they can survive that tough stretch, they could be headed for a playoff run.

#  Points indicate potential success for Tennessee Titans in sports betting

The upcoming NFL season is a chance for the Tennessee Titans to prove that they are a top-tier team in the league. In the past, they have shown flashes of brilliance, but have not been able to put together a complete season. This year, there are several points indicating that the Titans could be a success in sports betting.

One reason to believe in the Titans is their strong offense. Led by Marcus Mariota at quarterback, the team has one of the most explosive offenses in the league. They are also well-rounded, with a good running game and dangerous receivers.

On defense, the Titans have made some key additions, including Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan. These players bring championship experience and should help solidify the secondary.

Another factor that could work in the Titans’ favor is their schedule. They do not face any of the top teams in their division until week 8, which gives them time to gel as a team and figure out their strengths and weaknesses.

All of these factors point to potential success for the Titans this season. If they can manage to stay healthy and play up to their potential, they could easily be one of the top teams in the league. This makes them an attractive option for sports betting fans who want to make some smart bets on this year’s NFL games.
