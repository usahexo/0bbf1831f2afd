#  Nevada Cites 18 Online Casinos for Illegal Gambling

On Tuesday, the state of Nevada announced that it has charged 18 online casinos with illegal gambling. The announcement was made at a news conference by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Attorney General's office.

The casinos are all owned or operated by companies based in Costa Rica. They were charged with offering illegal gambling services to U.S. residents, and with violating the state's laws against unlicensed gambling operators.

"This is another example of our efforts to protect Nevadans and legitimate businesses from those who choose to operate illegally," said Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett. "We appreciate the Attorney General's office working closely with us on this case."

The AG's office said that it had been investigating the online casinos for over a year, and that it would be seeking civil penalties and restitution for Nevada residents who had lost money gambling at the sites.

#  Prosecution of Internet Gambling Sites Ramps Up

The prosecution of internet gambling sites was ramped up this week with the indictment of three site operators and the arrest of 11 people associated with the sites.

The sites, which were based in Costa Rica, were accused of violating federal gambling laws.

According to prosecutors, the operators of the sites took in more than $3 million in bets.

The indictment charged the operators with conspiracy to violate the federal gambling law, operating an illegal gambling business and money laundering.

“These arrests and indictments send a clear message that those who operate online gambling businesses from within the United States will be prosecuted,” said Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

This week’s arrests are just the latest in a string of crackdowns on internet gambling sites. In April 2011, federal prosecutors shut down 10 such sites.

While there has been little movement on legislation to legalize and regulate internet gambling at the federal level, some states have taken steps to allow such activities within their borders. Nevada and Delaware have both legalized online poker, while New Jersey is expected to do so later this year.

#  Police Raid Offices of Online Casino Operator

Police yesterday raided the offices of an online casino operator as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of illegal gambling.

Officers seized computers and documents as part of their search, and arrested one member of staff.

A spokesperson for the police said that the raid was part of a wider operation targeting several online casinos.

The online casino industry has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several operators facing accusations of operating illegal gaming sites. In 2015, the UK Gambling Commission warned operators that they must take steps to prevent under-aged players from accessing their sites.

#  $1.5M seized in crackdown on illegal gambling

The Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions, has announced a crackdown on illegal gambling operations across the country. This includes $1.5 million in assets seized from an illegal gambling ring in New York.

The operation, which was headed by 34-year-old Alexander Kostantinov, netted over $5 million in profits since it began in early 2017. Kostantinov has been charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

This is the latest in a series of crackdowns by the Department of Justice on illegal gambling operations. In December 2017, federal agents shut down three online casinos that were operating illegally in the United States.

Illegal gambling is a major problem in the United States, and one that is often overlooked by law enforcement officials. This crackdown is a positive step forward in preventing this form of crime from spreading further.

#  FBI investigating illegal gambling ring

The FBI is currently investigating an illegal gambling ring that is said to have ties to organized crime. The ring is said to have been operating for several years, and is believed to have made millions of dollars in profits.

Gambling is a big business in the United States, and is estimated to generate more than $100 billion in revenue each year. However, much of this gambling is done illegally, and the FBI has been cracking down on gambling rings in recent years.

The investigation into the current ring is still ongoing, and no arrests have yet been made. However, authorities are confident that they will be able to make arrests soon, and that the ring will be brought to justice.

# What is an illegal gambling ring?

An illegal gambling ring is a group of people who come together to gamble illegally. This can include everything from betting on sports games to playing casino games online.

Illegal gambling rings are often tied to organized crime groups, as these groups can offer protection and help with money laundering. This makes it difficult for law enforcement officials to shut down these rings, as they often have powerful allies.

# Why are illegal gambling rings a problem?

Illegal gambling rings are a problem because they deprive the government of tax revenue and they can be connected to other criminal activities. They also often prey on vulnerable people, such as those who are addicted to gambling or those who are struggling financially.

Illegal gambling can also be dangerous, as it can lead to violence and financial instability. In addition, it can be addictive and ruin lives. That’s why it’s important that law enforcement officials crack down on these rings whenever possible.
