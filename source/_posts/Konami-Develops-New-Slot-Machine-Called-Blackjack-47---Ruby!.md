#  Get Ready For A New Twist On Classic Blackjack with Blackjack 47 - Ruby From Konami

It has been some time since Konami released a new Blackjack game to the market, but they have just announced their newest game in the series: Blackjack 47. This is a blackjack game with a unique twist that should appeal to all kinds of players.

Unlike traditional blackjack games, in Blackjack 47 you can only bust on your first two cards. If you hit and get another card that would take your total over 21, then your hand automatically busts - no matter what the value of that card is.

This makes the game much more exciting, especially for players who like to take risks. With each hand, you'll need to decide whether or not to hit or stand based on the risk-reward ratio - and knowing when to fold can be just as important as knowing when to bet big.

In addition to the standard blackjack rules, Blackjack 47 also includes a number of special bonus rounds that can help you boost your bankroll. These bonus rounds are activated when you get certain combinations of cards, and can award anything from extra cash to free spins.

So if you're looking for a new and exciting blackjack game, be sure to check out Blackjack 47 - Ruby from Konami. It's sure to provide hours of entertainment and excitement!
