#  How to Play 21 Not BlackJack Pound for Fun and Profit

This how-to guide is for those who want to enjoy the casino classic known as blackjack or 21 without risking any money. The game can be played for free at most online casinos with no download required. Alternatively, you can use fake money if you want to practise before playing with real cash.

First, choose a blackjack game that suits your skill level. If you’re a beginner, look for games with low betting limits and easy-to-follow rules. More experienced players can take on higher stakes games with more complex rule variations.

Once you’ve found a game to your liking, it’s time to place your bets. In blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, or by having the dealer bust (go over 21). You can bet on whether you think you’ll win or lose each hand, and you can also place side bets on different things like whether both you and the dealer will get blackjacks (two cards of the same rank), whether your first two cards will form a natural blackjack (21 points), or whether the final card in the deck will be a spade.

To play, simply select your bet amount and hit the Deal button. You will then be dealt two cards face up and the dealer will get two cards - one face up and one face down. Based on your hand and the dealer’s visible card, you can decide whether to hit (take another card), stand (stick with what you have), double down (double your bet and take one more card), split (split your hand into two separate hands if both cards are of equal value), or forfeit/fold (give up). After making your decision, hit Draw or Reveal to see what happens next.

If your total points are higher than the dealer’s without going over 21, you win! The amount of money you win depends on how much money you wagered on that hand: multiply your original bet by 1.5 if you won as a regular player, 2x if you won as a blackjack insurance player, or 3x if your first two cards were a natural blackjack. If your total points are lower than the dealer’s without going bust, then you lose - however, some casinos let players recoup some losses if they hit "Insurance". This is where players bet that the dealer has blackjack - if they do, then players collect even money on their insurance bets; otherwise they lose them.

Now that you know how to play blackjack for free at an online casino, why not give it a try? Remember to relax and have fun - after all, it's only pretend money!

#  A Beginners Guide to Playing 21 Not BlackJack Pound

In casinos, blackjack is played with one or more 52-card decks. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and aces are worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player’s wishes. The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 points without going over. Points are scored by counting the number of points on each card. Face cards (kings, queens and jacks) score 10 points each, and an ace counts as 1 or 11 points.

Players can hit (receive another card from the dealer) up to a total of three times; once per round of play. If they hit when their total is already at 21 (a bust), they lose the hand immediately no matter what the dealer has. After taking a hit, players must decide whether to stand (stick with what they have) or double down (double their bet and receive just one more card).

When both the player and dealer have finished playing their hands, the player’s score is compared with that of the dealer. If the player’s total is higher than the dealer’s, the player wins! In casino versions of blackjack, if both player and dealer have identical totals (a push), neither player nor dealer wins nor loses money on that particular hand.

There are many different variations on blackjack – including some where players can bet on multiple hands at once – but the basic rules remain more or less the same for all of them. Blackjack is an exciting game that’s easy to learn but can take years to master so make sure you take it slow when starting out!

#  How to Win at 21 Not Black Jack Pound Every Time

There are many games in the casino, but only one offers the player the chance to win big without having to risk much at all. The game is 21 (or black jack, as it is also known), and if played correctly, the house edge can be reduced to as little as 0.5%.

The premise of the game is simple – get as close to 21 as possible using two cards, and beat the dealer’s hand. Cards valued at 10 or 11 are considered strong hands, while 2 through 9 are worth their face value. Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what suits the player’s needs at the time.

To start, players place their bet in the designated area of the table. Once everyone has placed their bets, the dealer deals out two cards to each player and two cards to himself. The player with the highest value hand wins and players with a hand totaling 21 (or black jack) automatically win regardless of what the dealer has. In cases where two players have 21, the player with higher value suits (e.g., an Ace of Spades beats an Ace of Hearts) wins. If both players have the same suit, it is a tie and both players lose their wager.

If a player has less than 21 after receiving their first two cards, they can choose to take another card (hit) or stay with what they have (stand). Depending on whether they hit or stand will determine whether they go over 21 and lose automatically or whether they may still have a chance to win. If a player busts (goes over 21), they automatically lose no matter what the dealer has.

Once all players have either busted or decided to stand with their current total, the dealer reveals his second card. If his total is 16 or less, he must hit; if his total is 17 through 20, he must stand; and if his total is 21 through Ace, he draws no more cards (unless he already has a black jack). The dealer then compares his total against each individual players’ totals in turn and awards appropriate payouts accordingly.
