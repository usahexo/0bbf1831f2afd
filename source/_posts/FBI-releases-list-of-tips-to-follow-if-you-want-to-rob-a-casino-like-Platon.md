#  FBI releases list of tips to follow if you want to rob a casino like Platon

1. Have a solid plan: 
Before you even think about robbing a casino, make sure you have a solid plan in place. This means having a clear idea of the layout of the casino, where the security cameras are, what kind of security personnel are on duty, and what kind of escape routes are available.

2. Arrive armed and ready: 
Make sure you go into the casino heavily armed and prepared to take on any security personnel who get in your way. Casinos are usually well guarded, so you'll need all the firepower you can muster.

3. Steal quickly and quietly: 
Robbing a casino should be a quick and quiet operation, otherwise you'll risk attracting the attention of security and getting yourself into trouble. Plan your escape route ahead of time and make sure everything goes according to plan.

4. Avoid violence at all costs: 
Casino robberies can quickly turn violent if someone gets spooked, so try to avoid any unnecessary conflict. Stick to your plan and don't take any unnecessary risks.

5. Be patient: 
Robbing a casino is not an easy task, so be patient and don't rush things. If something doesn't go according to plan, don't panic – just adjust your strategy and keep moving forward.

#  How to make a million dollars like Platon in under an hour 

Platon, an investment banker and entrepreneur, shares his simple steps on how to make a million dollars like him in under an hour.

1. Identify a lucrative opportunity: the stock market is always a great place to start. Look for stocks that are undervalued and have potential for growth.

2. Buy low, sell high: this is basic investing advice, but it’s still essential to remember. When you purchase stocks, aim to buy them at a lower price than what they’re worth. Then, when it comes time to sell, sell them for more than you paid for them.

3. Manage your risk: no one knows exactly how the stock market will perform from day to day. That’s why it’s important to invest only what you can afford to lose and not put all your eggs in one basket.

4. Have patience and stay disciplined: investing takes time and patience – don’t get discouraged if your investments don’t immediately pay off. And be disciplined in order to stick to your plan and maximize your profits.
