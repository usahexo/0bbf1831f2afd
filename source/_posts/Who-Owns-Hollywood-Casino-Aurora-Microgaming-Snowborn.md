#  Are the Owners of Hollywood Casino Aurora Microgaming Snowborn Changing?

In early February, Hollywood Casino Aurora announced that they were going to be changing their software provider from Microgaming to Snowborn. This change has left many in the industry scratching their heads, as Microgaming is a well-respected and well-known software provider, while Snowborn is a newcomer to the market.

Some have speculated that this decision may have been made in an effort to curry favor with the Illinois Gaming Board. The Illinois Gaming Board has made it no secret that they are unhappy with Hollywood Casino Auroraâ€™s performance, and this move may be an attempt by the casino to appease the board.

Others believe that the switch to Snowborn is an effort by Hollywood Casino Aurora to compete with more recent casinos that have opened in Chicagoland. These newer casinos are often able to offer better promotions and bonuses than Hollywood Casino Aurora, and so the casino may be looking for ways to stay competitive.

Whatever the reason for the change, it is sure to create some upheaval in the industry. Microgaming is a well-respected company, and many of its games are popular among players. It is unclear how successful Snowborn will be in filling the shoes of Microgaming.
