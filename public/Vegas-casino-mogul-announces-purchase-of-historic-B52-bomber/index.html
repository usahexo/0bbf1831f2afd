The move is seen as an attempt by the billionaire to increase tourist traffic to his casinos in Las Vegas and Macau.</p>
<p>The plane, which is currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, will be shipped to a yet-to-be-determined location in either state. “This is a major acquisition for my company,” said Adelson at a press conference yesterday. “It will bring people from all over the world to see this amazing piece of aviation history.”</p>
<p>The B52 bomber was first introduced into service in 1952 and saw extensive action in the Vietnam War. It was retired from active duty in 1992 but has remained in service with the air force reserves. The plane on display at the museum is one of only two remaining airworthy models.</p>
<p>Adelson did not disclose how much he paid for the bomber but hinted that it was a “significant investment.” He added that he plans to use it as a “flying billboard” to promote his hotels and casinos.</p>

The project would include a new hotel, restaurants, and a theater.</p>
<p>The casino owner, who asked to remain anonymous, says that he has been working on the project for several years. He has been negotiating with the owner of the landmark property, and he is now hoping to get state approval for the project.</p>
<p>If approved, the project would create hundreds of jobs and bring millions of dollars in tourism revenue to Iowa. The casino owner says that he is committed to making the project a success and that he is confident that it will be a boon to the local economy.</p>

<p>The steel behemoth, which first flew in 1952 and was decommissioned in 1993, will become the centerpiece of a new outdoor attraction at the $2.5 billion resort, to be called “The Park.”</p>
<p>“This is a tremendous acquisition for The Park and for our guests,” said Robert Goldstein, president of Resort Properties of America, the Adelson-owned company that is developing the property. “The B-52 is an American icon and its addition will make our outdoor attraction one of the most unique in the country.”</p>
<p>Adelson, who ranks as the eighth-richest person in America with a net worth of $25.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, already owns one of the world’s largest collections of slot machines. The new resort will house his personal collection of antique cars as well.</p>

<p>The new resort, which is expected to cost $2.5 billion to build, will have more than 1,000 rooms and will include a casino, a spa, restaurants, and other amenities.</p>
<p>Adelson said that the resort is expected to create 4,000 jobs and that it will be “the biggest and best destination in the Midwest.”</p>
<p>The project still needs to be approved by the Iowa Gaming Commission, but Adelson said he is confident that the commission will approve it.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about this opportunity,” he said. “It’s going to be a world-class resort.”</p>

<p>Sheldon Adelson, who owns the Venetian and Palazzo casinos in Las Vegas, paid $8 million for the Cold War-era bomber at an auction in Ohio on Thursday.</p>
<p>He says he plans to have it flown to Las Vegas and put on display at the Aviation Museum of Nevada.</p>
<p>The 82-foot-long bomber, which can carry up to 50,000 pounds of bombs, was used in the Vietnam War and is one of only two remaining examples of its type.</p>
<p>It was retired from service in 1994 and has been displayed at air shows across the country.</p>
